          <p className="text-charcoal-700 mb-4">
            For over 15 years, each piece that leaves our workshop has been shaped by hand with traditional techniques passed down through generations, combined with contemporary design sensibilities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal-700 mb-4">
            We source only the finest sustainable hardwoods, carefully selecting each board for its unique character and grain pattern. From the initial sketch to the final hand-rubbed finish, every step is performed with meticulous attention to detail.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal-700">
            Our commitment to quality means we never cut corners or rush the process. A piece of our furniture isn't just built to look beautiful todayâ€”it's crafted to become an heirloom that will tell your family's story for generations.
